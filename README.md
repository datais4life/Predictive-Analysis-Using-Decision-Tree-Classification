# Predictive-Analysis-Using-Decision-Tree-Classification
<p> A data set is analyzed for churn using a decision tree classifier from Sci-Kit Learn in a Jupyter Notebook with the Python 3 programming language. The data is cleaned, explored, and wrangled to prepare it for analysis. The target variable is identified, and the data is split into training and testing sets. Following the use of the decision tree classifier from Sci-Kit Learn, Graphviz and PydotPlus are used to display the decision tree. This identifies the attributes with the most influence on the target variable. The decision boundaries are visualized in a scatterplot using Seaborn. The accuracy of the training and testing data sets is evaluated with a confusion matrix. </p>
